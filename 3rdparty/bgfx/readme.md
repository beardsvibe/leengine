# BGFX

We use a prebuilt libs here:

- bgfx commit `f52fbccb2fb557dee98102848e8a19c3b70a25fe`
- bx commit `462a5969c22a7294cc865805dcdcae5d37428537`
- bimg commit `1117bb0d003d6b80558a88ff457a7ed471b87216`

We have minor changes in headers to put everything into one include folder because we only need C99 headers.
